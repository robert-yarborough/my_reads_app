#Functionality


In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves"
(i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books.
The three shelves are:

1. Currently Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Read


Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that
book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
Note that the default value for the control should always be the
current shelf the book is in.
