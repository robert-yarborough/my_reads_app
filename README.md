#myReads react app with express api

This app offers a user a general usage capability, in the sense it allows
a user to select from a category, ( defined as either a READ, WANT TO READ,
or a CURRENTLY READING ) constant. Once a category is selected from a categorical
selection component, the user has the ability to move the current book to
another category.
Users are also able to search a database of books, and add them to there
library, which can then be categorized.
